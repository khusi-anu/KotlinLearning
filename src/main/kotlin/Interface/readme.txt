inheritance is different from abstract class

abstract class vs inheritance
1. abstract class can have constructor and init block
but inheritance can't have constructor or inheritance

2. in kotlin similar to java, we can extends only one class(eitther abstract
or normal class)

3. in kotlin interface can have method both simple and abstract

with interface we can achieve multiple inheritancein kotlin like java

if two interface has same method and one class implements both in that
case how that method witll gets called - lets check
